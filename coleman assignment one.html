    <h4>Patented Technology</h4>
    <p class = "science-text"> Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music , including technology to elict <b>strong neral phase locking</b> - allowing populations of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated activity- and technology to remove distraction in sound .</p>
    <p class ="science-text">This makes our music unique, purpose built to steer you into a desired mental state. In other words, we ve found a new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do</p>

    <h1><b>Tested on Brain and Behavior</b></h1>
    <p class="science text">we look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and Eeg, and also run large- scale behavioral tests, measuring performance on simple games</p>
    <p class="science text"> <b>Our experiments always include a control condition (placebo)</b> of the same  underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can be sure our tech is what makes the difference.</p>
